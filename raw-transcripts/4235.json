The more you go up into mathematics and the different graphs that you create will get weirder and weirder looking in real life situation. You've probably had a lot of experience with linear graphs up until this point. So there are lines, time is usually on the X axis and they move left to right pretty fluidly. So your brain is like, wait, wait, I don't like this. I have to go backwards. So what I'm going to challenge you to do is keep time on the vertical axis.

So anytime you're working with graphs, remember they are going to start to look more and more bizarre and weird and different.

I have another variable that's changing and it's represented on another axis. And then how those two things are changing together is what the graph represents. Your graph represents how speed is changing in relation to time. Is the car traveling the entire speed for four hours at the same speed?"
